## Date Created
June 29, 2024

## Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data Analysis

## Project Description
This project uses Python to explore bikeshare data from three major cities in the US: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The goal is to analyze and calculate descriptive statistics to better understand the usage of the bikeshare systems.

## Installation Requirements
- Python 3
- pandas
- NumPy

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Set Up a Virtual Environment
A virtual environment helps to manage dependencies for your project and prevents conflicts between packages. Follow these steps to set up a virtual environment:

#### Using `venv`:
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory where `bikeshare.py` is located.
3. Create a virtual environment by running:
   ```bash
   python -m venv bikeshare_env
   ```
   This will create a directory named `bikeshare_env` containing the virtual environment.

### Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment
Once the virtual environment is created, you need to activate it:

#### On Windows:
1. Run:
   ```bash
   bikeshare_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

#### On MacOS/Linux:
1. Run:
   ```bash
   source bikeshare_env/bin/activate
   ```

After activation, your terminal prompt will change to indicate that the virtual environment is active.

### Step 3: Install the Required Packages
With the virtual environment active, you can now install the necessary packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

Install the packages by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Instructions
1. Ensure that you have installed all the necessary libraries.
2. Place the data files `chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, and `washington.csv` in the same directory as the `bikeshare.py` file.
3. Run the `bikeshare.py` file using the command: `python bikeshare.py`.
4. Follow the instructions in the terminal to view descriptive statistics and raw data.
